# RollingCheeseRace

Hi, this is an in-progress minigame made in UE4 inspired in Cooper's Hill Rolling-cheese Race:

Its main idea is to use the included "Physical Animation" to simulate poses or animations applied to the protagonist while 
is falling in Ragdoll. This game is a physics-based one and it pretends to be one of many which uses this technique. 

It is a multiplatform open-source game which means that anyone could make changes to it for others to play. 




Thank you, 

David



Pd for geeks:
my idea is to upgrade it by adding neural networks for the protagonist to balance by itself. Like in NaturalMotion's games
